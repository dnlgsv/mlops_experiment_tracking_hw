Description:

Conduct several experiments:

  use different features
  
  do hyperparameter search
  
  different models/network architectures
  
  Results of each experiment should be tracked in MLFlow
  
  Best model artifacts should be logged as well

Criteria:

  Experiments should be fully reproducible
  
  Both client and server are implemented (there are two running containers - one with your model and pipeline and one with just a MLFlow server). 
  
  Use docker-compose for this task.
  
  Visualizations / reports on experiment results
  
  Clean code / code quality tools are used
